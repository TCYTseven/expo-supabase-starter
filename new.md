# Smart8Ball App Concept

## Overview
Design a concept with a few different scenes for an app called **"Smart8Ball"**. This is an AI-powered tool that helps users navigate the decision-making process by mapping out decisions through flowcharts and assisting them in real-time. It functions like a therapist, providing checkpoints to help users confront their decisions and think critically about them. Instead of writing out pros and cons, users can tap buttons for "Yes," "No," or "Custom (text input)" decisions, which will map out the future of the flowchart.

## Scenes

### Scene 1: Decide Page
- The **Decide Page** should start by prompting the user for input.
- Include a **microphone button** that allows the user to explain their request verbally.
- After the initial explanation, the rest of the interaction should be button-based (as mentioned above) rather than voice-based.
- Below the buttons, there should be a small rectangular box where users can upload any optional context (e.g., screenshots) for the AI to consider.

### Scene 2: Decide Page After Request Processed
- This page will display the generated flowcharts vertically, which will automatically scroll down as the flowchart is created for the user.
- Use **purple, elegant UI lines** to keep the design simple yet appealing.
- Ensure that the flowcharts are user-friendly and visually engaging, with slight downward animations during generation.
